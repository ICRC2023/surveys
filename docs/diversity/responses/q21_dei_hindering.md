# Q21. Hindering DE&I

## Question

What reasons do you think are hindering DE&I initiatives in science?

## Answers

- The inertia of institutions.
- Most researchers have no time for this unless personally affected.
- It is not taken seriously. This lack of serious preparation of this survey is one example.
- It is a bit too complicated for people to understand how to best solve the problem. There are as many as 8 categories of identification (eg, LBGTQ+) and other groups: women, latinos and other people of color, native islanders, and now four categories of how they are to be treated (is there enough diversity from all groups, are they being treated equitably, are they being included, is there enough gender balance, is there enough balance of all the groups). It is not even clear that DE&I success is defined the same by all the different categories.
- Conservative ways of thinking.
- Education of world history in high schools and universities.
- The postdoc positions are short term and very unstable. And permanent positions are rare.
- None.
- Economy.
- I don't know, but it may be due to the mindset of the parents' generation at home.
- People in charge of Administration, and in decision making posts are still managing misogyny, and have strong bias against women and other groups.
- The old beliefs, but this is changing, slowly, but it's changing
- Pervasive stereotypes. The idea that science is accomplished by geniuses.
- No.
- They produce to few papers.
- Same as society.
- Lazyness.
- Historic family matters.
- Old way of thinking.
- Good role model. Biased idea due to community tradition.
- Inertia and fear of change from the community is hindering the initiatives.
- There should be none.
- The social structure as a whole, first. Minority groups are often related with poor income situations which deals with the whole set of consequences avoiding their inclusion. Scientific communities do not promote encouragement programs for diversity, in general. Once they do, it is mostly a imagistic approach without recognizing the true relevance of it.
- Male majority and lack of knowledge about what is discrimination and it's types.
- There is no money available for that. If you want to e.g. prolong the contract of a pregnant woman, you cannot because you won't get money for that.
- No.
- The main effect is of disequity is in school or even before. We try to cure something in universities at an age much too late.
- Obsolete mentalities and personal/society biases.
- The people at the top.
- Mostly old school male professors that are the only ones that got access to academia in the decades before the 21st century.
- The fast science system, the rigid and established structures.
- Lazyness, ignorance towards the necessity if these initiatives, people who want to sustain current hierarchies, old views about roles, gender, racism, non-attentiveness, workload.
- History.
- Money.
- Societal expectations put on women
- Men who think that supporting other genders implies they will be dismissed
- Prefer not to answer
- People should accept anyone in the research field irrespective of the cast, group etc. Grouping shouldn't be there, it not only kills opportunities for the deserved ones but also makes the field corrupted and not likeable.
- It isn't supported monetarily to the level that it needs to be.  People at institutions are often asked to take on DE&I roles or head initiatives in addition to their regular duties without adequate support (e.g., extra staffing, extra financial resources).
- Indifference.
- Science is sometimes seen as a risky career path compared to other areas that might have easier or clearer paths to a permanent position.
- Politics and cultural stuff.
- Scientists are not exempt of the sociocultural biases of their society, and most of them will tend to reproduce those biases (even if just by inertia) unless they accept to undergo a real process of deconstruction of their privileges.  It is an effort that not everybody is ready to make. Colleagues from the most favoured groups tend to feel attacked by such initiatives.
- People who are not subject to discrimination are often unaware of the issues.
- They aren't seen as a priority.
- The whole task is an uphill battle. Changing society and old structures is incredibly hard. It is also easy as part of the privileged majority to brush the issues aside - and I don't even think that is an excuse. Working in science is taxing, the payment is poor, the workload intense, the next deadline always on the horizon. I think a lot of people really do mean well, but are just to caught up to go the extra mile and make a change.
- Most of the top positions (research managers, full professors, etc.) in science are held by males who are not sensitive to gender equality issues, and this hinders dedicated initiatives, which generally come from the bottom up. But the topic is very complex.
- Lack of buy-in and effort from people in positions of power; people's refusal to recognize biases against other groups; the assumption that science is a meritocracy.
- Some (older) people "in charge" lack of interest.
- Competition.
- Poorly supported motherhood of the society, stealth hierarchy, geopolitics.
- They are mostly attended and performed by underrepresented groups. This eventually leads a larger share of labour performed by those groups into DE&I while large-scale structural change rarely happens.
- Most of the time, female scientists are expected to organize those initiatives in addition to their work in science and they do simply not have enough time.
- Old Ideas, such as that man works outside the home, wife does the housework.
- Traditions ("we have always done it this way"), too much requiring people to prove they belong in the field (not enough welcome).
- Strong hierarchy in science and life-time professorships can hinder initiatives due to regressive thinking (generational gap between professors and graduates/postdocs in general sometimes problematic).
- Social bias. Unconscious gender bias by majority (= male).
- Currently some old scientists who still are old-minded.
- Often by the time there are initiatives it is too late in the stage of people's education and those that are underrepresented are already lacking the same preparation (particularly for some ethnic backgrounds).  People still have biases in their views.  There is a culture of over-work in science which is not healthy or attractive to many and particularly not for women who want to be able to spend time with their families. Men should also want to spend time with their families but the culture within science doesn't encourage it. Similarly it is hard to have time to pursue other interests such as sport or cultural hobbies.
- Laziness, lack of interest.
- Old structures take work to overcome and staff scientists are not paid to do that but publish papers, so there is no one whose actual job description includes changing the system to make it easier for minorities to enter science.
- Older generations still believing in peoples 'roles in society' set up since their birth. These beliefs show through in their comments and treatment of students coming into the field.
- People from majority groups are less likely to care about DE&I initiatives which is why the support is still not enough. Most of the time DE&I sessions are not mandatory sessions, which means that there might be a number of people reached by those initiatives but those people are interested in the topic already. This way it is a lot harder to reach people that are not as interested in the topic and (often times) are the reason why problems in this field even arise.
- I think in science there is still some old-white male dominance, however I think that new generation will not have the same prejudices of such a gruop of people. This issue will probably disappear with time. Another issue is that some time DE&I initiatives seem just a way to "wash owr conscience" with doubtful impact on society. Onother point it that DE&I initiatives should be tailored on countries specific needs. I do not think there is a good approach valid for all countries.
- The high competition, very short post-doc contracts and the need to move to different places makes it very family hostile. It should be also possible to have part-time jobs in science.
- Lack of interest.
- People who still falsely believe that skill is the only thing that decides if you're successful in science or not. I'd say skill is maybe 10-20%, the rest is luck and based on what kind of starting conditions you had. (gender, income, skin color, land of origin ...).
- DEI initiatives are not being hindered. They are working in the exact way they were designed for: they create a feeling that something is being done, but effectively, it isn't. We continue to have few women and diverse people in Science and/or leadership positions, because DEI initiatives don't mean to change that. The few who manage to overcome all the biases, harassment and lack of support, when they finally are part of the scientific/academic community, they often feel alone, not belonging and have to work in a toxic environment. Then, they might drop out.
- Socioeconomic status.
- "tradition" and stubborn old men.
- Money, and little time.
- The low numbers of female and diverse groups in our discipline.
- Men don't care and won't do enough to be allies.
- There still exists a group of very conservative scientists from old generation who can block the changes in scientific community, by sabotaging careers of young scholars from minorities.
- The method of description may be one of the obstacles for good gender balance.
- Activities to increase it are loudly proclaimed and generally ineffective. This makes people think enough is being done with it and that they don't need to contribute. This couldn't be more wrong.
- As long as the stereotype and social structure that men work and women take care of household chores persist, it may be challenging to bring about change. These are not solely individual consciousness issues but also depend on the political situation and culture of each country, which means that actively dismantling these concepts can sometimes result in social drawbacks and political pressures. Therefore, it may be necessary to cultivate individuals who have received education emphasizing the need for DE&I from a young age, while also waiting until those individuals holding the aforementioned stereotype are no longer present.
- A complex web of structural and systemic factors and who knows what else, buddy.
- Many people don't think it is an issue, or at least an issue in their immediate environment. Others feel that current initiatives have "gone too far". Also, it almost always falls on the minority/disadvantaged groups to try to educate others and make changes.
- There is no one-size fits all solution.
- Education on DE&I is very poor.
- Old fashioned PIs.
- There is an overall lack of awareness. Even well intentioned people may not realize that they are still part of the problem.
- Common sense.
- More diverse undergraduate students in astroparticle physics may be needed.
- un-interest of white, powerful, middle-age men (and also some women)
- In our country, nothing is hindering such initiatives.
- One thing is that many established scientists who have had to struggle to succeed in their careers feel that it is only fair for new, early career scientists to have to struggle in the same way, even if things can be done to alleviate that struggling. In truth, no one should have to suffer needlessly, and we should actively work not to pass on generational trauma to future generations of academics.   Another thing is that many institutions pride themselves on being elite and exclusive, but then talk internally about ways to be "inclusive." These ideas seem fundamentally at odds with one another, and I think the whole concept of elitism should be challenged.  
- We still center the ideas of whiteness and patriarchy. Diversity also has to include these identities. The very basis of the definition of diversity is everyone who is othered from whiteness or maleness, which presents a huge problem because we continue to make what is "normal" in science these two social constructs. 
- It is difficult to see the world under a different perspective that is not the "white male dominance", not only for "white man" but also for all the other "categories"
- The entire community needs to contribute because it impacts us as a whole, but more often than not, the people who put in the most work for DEIA initiatives are from the underrepresented groups and are overburdened.
- Patronizing and nepotism. Irrelevant science for ineffective Professors, instead of a common vision
- I believe there is still a strong bias even among academia that white straight males are better at science than the rest of the population. And unfortunately, top positions are mostly filled by people who never experienced the feeling of not belonging in the field. Making it harder for them to understand the issue and even recognise it. I believe, sessions like this one can be eye-opening to some and might push them to make efforts in their own group. 
people are busy with science, don't have time for other things
Laws and traditional views and thinking.
People who believe it isn't necessary because not everyone can find a job in science, or because improvements have already been made.
