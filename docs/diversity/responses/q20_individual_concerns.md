(WIP)

- Not entirely sure what the difference is between the four categories, nor why as many as four are needed (if the population has diversity, aren't they included?  I am sure there is some academic distinction, but this gets lost on most).
- I found it is becoming more and more difficult to get both "Gender balance" and "Equity"
- The small number of young women who aspire to become researchers.
- I don't agree with your suggestion on providing one female and male to give the highlight talk, I would suggest you provide a female who has been a mom but still work on science study. As a mom, I was feeling like I was neglected, they just select young single lady who has less experience.
- It needs improvement, but at least positive steps on that direction are on. 
- The fact that there is an open call for women's quota employment is very problematic because it is gender discriminatory.
- None at the moment.
- It happens that people are "too busy" for this. These initiatives should be organized in a way that everyone can participate. Small events are also important!
- Current DEI efforts create inequality in order to generate equality. That is artificial and generate more problems than it solves. One example is in the context of hiring. Every time someone advocates for hiring/selecting a student for these reasons, the person will have to prove themselves to show that they are indeed capable. Inclusion is different from D and E, since it implies making the workplace and group dynamics accessible to accommodate people with disabilities, for instance. This is fine and should be done.
- The scientific community is biased towards privileged groups. Minorities are not included without tremendous and unequal amount of effort.
- Equity is important, but equal rights and chances are more important. I don't think women or minorities should be given a preference for positions if less qualified, but I observe that this happens. 
- I struggle with the patriarchal structures and rigid hierarchies.
- Definitely not.
- No. As I said, I am favorable to positive discrimination as long as it is necessary to achieve a balanced distribution of individuals within science, even if for a while it means giving less chances to the persons belonging to already favoured groups.
- Suffered discrimination as a foreigner for many years, until obtaining citizenship in the nation where I work. Salary levels are cumulative, so my salary level is still much lower than native-born citizens at my professional level.
- They need to be taken more seriously.
- No problems.
- DEI work is often seen as separate or secondary work, while it should be a core part of doing research work and hiring.
- Possible over-bias. But I would still advocate that it is necessary.
- Work life balance is way too poor.
- They are often not very effective in changing the negative or exclusionary culture of a department or working group and are focused traditionally only on gender issues rather than intersectionality.
- Often, female scientists are expected to organize them in addition to their work in science, which is a lot. There should be people hired specifically to organize those initiatives.
- In science, labour rules are not followed. Family people need to work harder to get to the same starting line.
- Girls are losing their interests in science during the teen ages.
- I am concerned that there is a gender imbalance and also participation doesn't represent the ethnic diversity of the population in some countries.
- No.
- Unclear if 50%/50% will be the equilibrium. Some initiatives will lead to discrimination of the currently considered overrepresented groups.
- No.
- Compatibility of family and academic career (changing locations during the postdoc phase can be hard).
- No.
- I think a lot of it occurs without considering the needs. Just having someone talk to groups about being inclusive isn't going to be impactful. Instead, we could be showing what the response of reporting bad behaviors is: are there going to be repercussions if you report harassment? will there be measures in place to protect you as a reporting person? what could happen if (for example) someone is reported for inappropriate behavior, are they spoken to, are they suspended and made to take workshops addressing this behavior, are they fired immediately without question?  By rather addressing these concerns, it allows specifically women or gendered minorities feel heard and able to speak out against someone making their career an inconvenience to others.
- No.
- As I wrote before, I think we should concentrate on strategies that can make a real impact an avoid to implement strategies that can have a negative feedback. For example, forcing to have 50% of women speakers in a conference in a field where the woman presence is in general much smaller than 50%, has two negative consequence: 1) the quality of speaker will be lower and 2) women working in that specific field will have a large number of request to participate to conferences that will not allow them to work properly, producing less scientific result compared to their potential.
Chaotic career paths against family planning, historically white-male dominated fields, awards for biggest egos which makes access for underrepresented groups worse
- Often it doesn't reach the people that would actually need to be convinced about the need to have these initiatives; it rather stays in the bubble of already interested people.
- The biggest concern is that the current initiatives don’t bring any structural/system changes. 
- I feel like it is going too far in terms of trying to hire more females, regardless of their capabilities, and that is not how it should be going.
- In my view it is important to have a clear vision and focus, and work constructively on accomplishing the formulated goals while acknowledging which changes are realistic and feasible. For example, starting extended discussions about different political perspectives and sometimes even ideological worldviews can impede progress on concrete and effective solutions.
- No.
- Not always culturally aware or assume USA/Canadian culture and norms.
- Intersex, asexual and aromantic people are usually forgotten, and many initiatives are just a bunch of words which never become real
- No there should be more.
- They are always related to childcare which is a lesbian with no kids doesn't interest me.
- No.
- I frankly don't understand why learning to better collaborate and communicate with others is at all controversial. If people don't like the political framing of DE&I then they should just look at it as improving their interpersonal skills. Also. we tend to pat our backs by looking at all the activities that are being put forward to increase diversity, but then ignore the numbers which are obviously going the wrong way. 
- I have the feeling that my thoughts are always behind the ones of my male colleagues and that I must do much more efforts to reach the same results
- As a woman, I feel treated as if I had a problem or disability or disadvantage when I see scholarships only for women. I also feel it is truly unfair for my male colleagues and friends. I think we should be treated equally, this means, we should be measured in the same way.
- There exists a persistent stereotype that women are not inclined toward science fields. By actively eliminating this perception from an early age, it would be possible to increase the number of women pursuing careers in science.
- No.
- My current position was only open to women as part of a DEI initiative. As a result, I have had issues with male colleagues not taking me seriously ("You only got your job because of your gender") or complaining that these positions discriminate against men.  
- Many of the modern initiatives are possibly becoming counterproductive by swamping overwhelmed people with procedure (e.g. generating bureaucracy, boilerplate policies, etc).
- No.
- There are not many options to continue a career as a researcher when you comes from a poor country. Also in some countries there are a different systems to get a PhD than the one in European countries. This topic is not very treated and many positions that said to incorporate people from not developed countries at the end do not do it.
- Yes.
- I utterly despise this Marxist DEI.
- No.
- Everyone can be happy the way he feels. That's OK. But there is no need to bother other people with "which gender I believe to be". Sorry. That's everyone's personal business. Gendering makes language a mess and is used to apply pressure to the majority of people.
- None
- NO
- Most of the issues only center around increasing the number of people. The major issues is that many scientists of non-white/non-male/non-cishetero origin have been contributing but have had their contributions erased or stories told years later. Also, you have to listen to the communities that are violated and I do not think those in power often listen to those communities because it is uncomfortable for them. 
- They are not enough 
- Increasing diversity, inclusion, and belonging are important goals that, if successful, can improve our science and our communities. However, I see too many simplistic efforts that focus on over-promoting existing members of our community from historically under-represented groups. Examples of this include applying simplistic numerical quotas to the decisions that are easy to quantify (e.g. number of plenary / invited speakers according to gender or other demographics, similar for faculty counts, similar for graduate student admissions).  I personally think that there has been pernicious sexism historically in science, including in physics and astronomy, for a long time, and there still is in some more subtle ways than previously, but also that this has improved over time and the more difficult challenges lie in society as a whole.  This is a more subtle challenge than focusing on the gates and gatekeepers in our field, as we have been doing too much by simply admitting prospective students from group X at a higher rate than from other groups, or similar at other levels of promotion such as faculty hiring, or similar for other decisions such as speakers to give prestigious talks.  I believe a better place to focus our effort is broadening interest and knowledge in science in the public at all ages among all demographic backgrounds, particularly among children, to make sure that everyone from various backgrounds can become interested in science and pursue it.  As a concrete example: we often focus on the demographics of who was admitted to graduate school compared to who applied.  We much more rarely discuss who applied compared to a societal cross section, and improving this match is the more difficult but more valuable work.
- Expectations are not balanced across different groups, which is a major issue in retention and advancement.
- One size does not fit all. Such initiatives often reflect conditions and thinking in the US or Europe, and can be, and usually are, problematic when applied elsewhere.
- It has to be data driven to raise trust. Second concern: Science is international but you can only have initiatives in your home institution. Sexual harassment of professors that travel occur without consequences in the scientific field, so you can not even change institution to escape.
- I am not sure if woman-only positions are really a good idea. They allow to restore a bit of balance but at the same time, as a woman, I would get the impression to only have been hired for this and not for my potential. I also believe that colleagues would view this that way too... It seems like a superficial solution to a deep problem that does not solve anything in the end... Most female colleagues I talked to tend to have imposter syndrome and this kind of initiative only accentuates that feeling
- Getting jobs because you are diverse rather than the most qualified candidate -- it can make you doubt yourself if you are really qualified for the job if you are diverse
- Progress is happening, but is slow.
