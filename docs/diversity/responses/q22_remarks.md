## Answers

- Total fucking joke.
- I am sorry but I don't know DE&I so I could not answer most questions.
- I would like the organizers to think again what DE&I works truly well in the human society.
- Good survey!
- Thank you.
- Thank you :).
- Very good.
- I was hoping you would give more consideration to sexual orientation.
- I did not understand half of the questions - they are poorly written. I was not sure what are you asking. You failed to explain what "DE&I" is and I needed to google it.
- No additional comments.  Thank you.
- Why this BS suddenly? I thought its something useful.
- Thanks for proposing this survey! It is interesting to get a snapshot at the vision of our community concerning these issues. I am curious to see the outcome.
- I think that some answers to the questions are either _very_ complex, have a lot of nuance and would deserve an 10 pages essay for a proper analysis, or at least are hard to answer as a white cis male. From my personal experience a lot is going in a good direction, but I'm in a privileged position and I don't want to speak for anyone who is not of that opinion.
- I would like the results to be made public.
- Hope you can push to make some real changes base on the results.
- In our experimental collaboration, we have DEI team to investigate the status regularly. It would be good to have such kind of activities in other groups/collaborations.
- I am 84 and retired so my comments are probably of little value.
- I thank the developers of this survey for investing their time in trying to gather data to show the current situation. But, effectively, this survey (as many other DEI surveys that I’ve responded so far) is just another example of what I said: look, we are doing something...but in reality, it probably won't bring any change….
- very good you made this survey.
- thank you for organizing this session, I very much look forward to attending and participating.
- Thanks for organizing the session!
- This survey is very new experience for me!
- Thanks for the opportunity to voice my opinion!
- I appreciate the anonymity of the poll. I feel it is not socially accepted to openly disagree with diversity/gender policies which favor supposedly disadvantaged groups. It would be nice if in the session there is a critical, scientific point of view in this aspect, and also open to alternative points of view, and it is not simply assumed that policies need to be implemented.
- Thank you for doing this.
- The inclusion seems fine to me as long as it is not forced.
- I'm looking forward to the discussion and connecting with the community.
- Some of the wording of the multiple choice questions does not make any sense to me, e.g. "What are your thoughts on diversity, equity & inclusion initiatives?" is not something I can answer with "agree" or "disagree".
- I find it interesting that the conference organizers required an extra surcharge for visa assistance. Given that is usually the poor countries that require visas to travel to Japan (which is already an expensive destination), I think that this will definitely serve to reduce diversity... and hence I wonder at the sincerity of this endeavour.
- Thank you for asking
